tube = cluster of clusters or pipes, non synchronized
    - type represented by cluster syntax: { | }
pipe = synchronized
data types = allow for tuples

T1 = { | } = T2

Do all the elaboration, typing, dispatching in the implicit flow form - to be able to generate SVG graphics afterwards.
Do all the optimizations in the flattened form - to be independent of the input source code structure.
